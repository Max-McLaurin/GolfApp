# GolfApp

This project contains a React Native application scaffold created with Expo. It demonstrates a basic flow for a golf side game and betting app, including:

- **Home Screen** – choose a game type (Skins, Wolf, Stroke Play)
- **Game Setup Screen** – add players and select side bets
- **Live Game Screen** – display scores and bet summaries in real time

Firebase is initialized for authentication and real-time database usage. Authentication uses anonymous sign in for testing purposes. Game calculations are placeholders to allow iteration on the user interface before integrating a full game engine.

Run the app with `npm start` (Expo CLI required).
